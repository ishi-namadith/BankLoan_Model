# Bank Marketing Analysis: Regression & Classification Models
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Bank Marketing dataset using both regression and classification models. The primary objective is to predict customer behavior in response to marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution.
The dataset, provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains information about direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) and whether clients subscribed to a term deposit. Two separate notebooks were developed to tackle different problem formulations:
- Regression Task: Predict the number of days the client will take to respond.
- Classification Task: Predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit (yes/no).
